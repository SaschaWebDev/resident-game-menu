A documentation about my learning during the process of creating this resident like game menu for the web from scratch.

## Illustrator

- Deselect view->Snap to Pixel for making working with paths easier
- When using the path tool holding the left key can created curves. It will continue to push curved lines on you. Pressing `ESC` will discontinue this behaviour. Then clicking `ALT` left click on the last anchor point will allow you to continue with a straight line from there on.
- The direct selection tool `a` can be used to alter specific anchor points manually
- The smoothing tool can be used to hand draw and smooth out specific curves that are not shaped well
- You can switch to the outline/preview/wireframe mode with `CTRL + Y` which can be used to check angles of different parts against each other and make them uniform
- Duplicate elements by dragging them and pressing `ALT`
- When more space around the illustration is needed use view->hide artboard bounds
- Send selected objects into the background/foreground with object -> send to back
